<p>
	At 22, Patrick Hsu has accomplished more than most people his age. During his doctoral training in the <a href="http://mco.mcb.harvard.edu/">Molecules, Cells, and Organisms</a> program under Xiaowei Zhuang in the Department of Chemistry and Feng Zhang at the Broad Institute, Hsu harnessed a bacterial immune system known as CRISPR and the protein Cas9 to edit DNA with incredible accuracy. And as a postdoctoral fellow at the <a href="https://www.broadinstitute.org/">Broad Institute</a>, he worked to translate this revolutionary technology for human gene therapy. In recognition of his extraordinary accomplishments and research, <a href="http://www.forbes.com/"><em>Forbes Magazine</em></a> named Hsu one of <a href="http://www.forbes.com/pictures/ggik45ekh/patrick-hsu-22/">2015&rsquo;s 30 Scientists Under 30</a>.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;I&#39;m honored to be on this year&#39;s Forbes 30 Under 30 list, and I&#39;m grateful to all my colleagues and mentors who nominated me,&rdquo; Hsu said. &ldquo;One of the great pleasures in life, in my view, is learning from smart people. Discovery and science is a team endeavor, so this just makes me very proud of everyone I&#39;ve been lucky to work with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Nominated by his co-advisor Feng Zhang as well as friends and colleagues through social media and Forbes&rsquo; website, Hsu was chosen by a panel of distinguished judges including Max Tegmark, an associate professor at MIT; Bahija Jallal, executive vice president of biotech company AstraZeneca&rsquo;s MedImmune division; and Jennifer Doudna, a University of California at Berkeley cell biologist and a leading CRISPR researcher. &quot;I feel very fortunate to have had Patrick as a collaborator over the past few years,&rdquo; said Zhang. &ldquo;His sharpness, creativity, and thoughtfulness belied the fact that he is only 22 years old.&quot;</p>
<p>
	CRISPR research is becoming increasingly popular in the fields of biology and biotechnology, and it has broad implications ranging from expanding our understanding of basic biology to developing a new generation of medical therapeutics&mdash;Hsu&rsquo;s interest. &ldquo;It is allowing us to push genome engineering technologies to modify genes and cells in innovative ways,&rdquo; said Hsu, who recently completed his postdoctoral fellowship at the Broad Institute.</p>
<p>
	Now at a biotech startup&mdash;<a href="http://editasmedicine.com/">Editas Medicine</a>&mdash;founded by Zhang and Harvard faculty members George Church, David Liu, and Keith Joung, Hsu is leading several early stage discovery projects to translate CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing technologies to treat human genetic and cellular diseases. &ldquo;The idea is to perform precise and corrective molecular modifications that correct a disease mutation and replace it with healthy sequence,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;This will allow us to develop therapeutic strategies that address the root cause and not just the symptoms of disease.&rdquo;</p>
