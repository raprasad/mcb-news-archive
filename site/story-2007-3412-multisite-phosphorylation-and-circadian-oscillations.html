	Circadian rhythms are daily cycles of behavior and metabolism that allow organisms to anticipate the 24-hour rhythm of the external environment.&nbsp; These rhythms are controlled by biological oscillators known as circadian clocks which&nbsp; are found throughout life, from prokaryotes to mammals. The simplest known circadian clock is found in photosynthetic cyanobacteria, and the core consists of three proteins: KaiA, KaiB and KaiC.&nbsp; Remarkably, as discovered by Takao Kondo&rsquo;s lab in 2005, the oscillator can be reconstituted in vitro; combining these three proteins with ATP in a test tube produces stable circadian oscillations in the phosphorylation state of KaiC that persist for many days.&nbsp; Thus, the interactions of these three proteins form the minimal core of a circadian clock.</p>
<p>
	Michael Rust and Joe Markson, a postdoc and graduate student in <a href="/Faculty/faculty_profile.php?f=erin-oshea">Erin O&rsquo;Shea</a>&rsquo;s lab, sought to understand the underlying mechanism that allows this system to generate stable oscillation.&nbsp; We suspected that the two phosphorylation sites on the autokinase/autophosphatase KaiC might not be functionally equivalent.&nbsp; To investigate this hypothesis, we used mass spectrometry, in collaboration with John Neveu, Bogdan Budnik and Renee Robinson in Bill Lane&rsquo;s group, to monitor KaiC phosphorylation throughout the circadian cycle.&nbsp; We determined that, indeed, KaiC&rsquo;s two phosphorylation sites play very different roles during the oscillation.&nbsp; The three possible phosphorylated forms appear in a cyclic pattern throughout the daily cycle.&nbsp; To determine the origin of this sequence of events, the authors studied the behavior of simpler partial reactions: either KaiC alone or KaiC with KaiA, which promotes phosphorylation.&nbsp; These experiments allowed them to measure the kinetic rate constants for phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of each site.</p>
<p>
	Further biochemical work showed that one specific phosphorylated form of KaiC interacts with KaiB, inactivating KaiA.&nbsp; To test if the measured kinetics along with this feedback loop were sufficient to explain oscillation, the authors, together with Daniel Fisher, now at Stanford, created a mathematical model incorporating these simple assumptions.&nbsp; Using independently measured rate constants, this model reproduces stable circadian oscillations in phosphorylation with the same structure as the experimental system.&nbsp; This work shows quantitatively how a protein with multiple phosphorylation sites can orchestrate interactions with other proteins to produce strong nonlinearities and generate complex behavior, such as stable oscillation.</p>
