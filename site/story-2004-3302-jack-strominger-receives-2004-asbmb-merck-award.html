		  <a href="/Faculty/faculty_profile.php?f=jack-strominger-l">Jack L. Strominger</a>, Higgins Professor of Biochemistry in MCB, is the recipient of the 2004 ASBMB-Merck Award in recognition of his outstanding contributions to research in biochemistry and molecular biology.&nbsp; In conjunction with the Award, Dr. Strominger spoke at the Annual Meeting of the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (ASBMB) in Boston, June 15, on &quot;The Structure of MHC Proteins and the Therapy of Multiple Sclerosis.&quot;</p>
		  <p>Dr. Alexander Rich, William Thompson Sedgwick Professor of Biophysics in the Department of Biology, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in nominating Dr. Strominger for the Award, noted Dr. Strominger&rsquo;s signal contributions in two distinct fields involving molecular recognition in immunity and infection.</p>
		  <p>Dr. Strominger&rsquo;s early research focused on the chemical structure of bacterial cell walls and how penicillin is recognized by bacterial enzymes.&nbsp; Dr. Rich notes that &quot;The field is now having a renaissance based on his early work.&nbsp; The bacterial cell wall components that he identified (and many of whose structures he elucidated) are now under investigation as the ligands for the Toll-like receptors on dendritic cells, the primary responders in the early innate immune system response.&nbsp; He discovered around 30 specific enzymes required for the biosynthesis of bacterial cell walls.&nbsp; As a result of emergence of drug resistant bacteria, many of these are now under investigation as possible targets for new chemotherapeutic agents&hellip;.His remarkable 1965 and 1980 publications on the penicillin mechanism were shown only [a few years ago] to be correct in even their most detailed hypotheses.&quot;</p>
		  <p>But this was only the first phase of Dr. Strominger&rsquo;s research.&nbsp; As Herbert Tabor, Editor of the <i>Journal of Biological Chemistry</i>, published by the ASBMB, commented, &quot;About 30 years ago he completely changed his interests and carried out critical experiments on the structures of the human major histocompatibility antigens and their roles in the immune system.&quot; Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens are key components of the immune system, involved in the recognition of self and foreign peptides.&nbsp; They are central to the cell response to infection and also to the immune response to grafts and transplantation, where transplanted tissue may be &quot;recognized&quot; as an infectious agent.&nbsp; </p>
		  <p>In two pathbreaking papers in the <i>Journal of Biological Chemistry</i>, Dr. Strominger reported two classes of MHC proteins (Class I and II) that are closely related in structure, their difference lying in the linkage of their four domains.&nbsp; Only one class had previously been recognized.&nbsp; Beyond this, Dr. Strominger was able to distinguish and crystallize several isotypes of the two classes of proteins.</p>
		  <p>In the course of this work, Dr. Strominger collaborated with the late Dr. Don Wiley, also of MCB, on the 3-D structure of MHC proteins.&nbsp; Dr. Wiley died in a tragic accident in 2001.&nbsp; In an interview, Dr. Strominger noted that it was a &quot;very fruitful collaboration, because we brought different approaches to science and different expertise to the research.&nbsp; He was a great scientist and a wonderful person.&quot;</p>
		  <p>In recent work, Dr. Strominger has applied the MHC work to study of human autoimmune diseases and in particular, multiple sclerosis (MS).&nbsp; He has redesigned a copolymer to better bind to the HLA-DR2 allotype of MHC II that is associated with MS and showed that this better-fitting copolymer was more effective than the existing copolymer as a therapeutic tool in treatment of experimental autoimmune encepahlomyelitis, the mouse model of MS.&nbsp; </p>
		  <p>In an interview, Dr. Rich commented that in his work on MHC, &quot;Dr. Strominger elucidated a central piece of the immune system.&quot;&nbsp; That Dr. Strominger was able to make such important findings in a second area of research is, according to Dr. Rich, a tribute to his &quot;versatility as a scientist and his nose for important research.&nbsp; The question of transplantation was just a big black box,&quot; when Dr. Strominger first looked at it.&nbsp; &quot;But he recognized that it was an important problem; solving it led to important insights.&quot;</p>
		  <p>Dr. Strominger himself takes an unassuming view of the course of his research.&nbsp; &quot;When I arrived at Harvard, I thought that penicillin research would not be as interesting as before, and I sought out new problems.&nbsp; The two areas of research turned out to be closely related, but I hadn&rsquo;t intended that.&nbsp; You can&rsquo;t really predict the outcome.&quot;&nbsp; Dr. Strominger expressed gratitude that the ASBMB-Merck Award &quot;recognizes 50 years of work in two different areas.&nbsp; It may be the first time that I&rsquo;ve received an award that included both areas of my research.&quot;</p>
		  <p>Dr. Rich commented:&nbsp; &quot;No other biochemist has pioneered more broadly in our science.&nbsp; His early discoveries are a milestone in microbiology.&nbsp; The later discoveries are arguably the most important contribution to the molecular basis of immune recognition in the past few decades.&quot;&nbsp; The ASBMB-Merck Award is a recognition of these achievements.</p>
