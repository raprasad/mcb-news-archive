          <a href="http://www.its.caltech.edu/%7Ebjorker">Pamela Bj&ouml;rkman</a> returns to MCB on Thursday, June 2nd, to deliver the 20th Konrad Bloch Lecture.&nbsp; Bj&ouml;rkman&rsquo;s research at Caltech has focused on the structure and function of proteins involved in cell surface recognition in immunity, an interest sparked by her graduate work.&nbsp; Bj&ouml;rkman received her PhD in biochemistry from Harvard University in 1984.&nbsp; As a graduate student and later a postdoctoral fellow in <a href="/DonWiley/">Don Wiley</a>&rsquo;s lab, Bj&ouml;rkman, in collaboration with <a href="/Faculty/faculty_profile.php?f=jack-strominger-l">Jack Strominger</a>, determined the crystal structure of the class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecule HLA-A2.&nbsp; The structure elucidated the mechanism of antigen presentation by these class I molecules.&nbsp; A groove at the top of the class I molecule, formed by two long &alpha;-helices, displayed the now famous &quot;extra density&quot;, which was attributed to bound peptide antigens.&nbsp; The two resulting publications in Nature are widely considered landmark papers in structural biology and immunology.&nbsp; Bj&ouml;rkman and Wiley won the 1994 Gairdner Foundation International Award for this work.&nbsp; Upon leaving Harvard, Bj&ouml;rkman first did a postdoctoral fellowship with Mark Davis at Stanford, working on T cell receptors.&nbsp; Bj&ouml;rkman then joined the faculty at Caltech in 1989, where she now is the Max Delbr&uuml;ck Professor of Biology and Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) Investigator.&nbsp; </p>
          <p>The Bj&ouml;rkman laboratory continues to study the structural biology of cell surface recognition and is particularly interested in the structure and function of structural homologs of class I MHC molecules.&nbsp; For example, crystal structures elucidated how the neonatal Fc receptor uses its class I-like fold to bind IgG molecules.&nbsp; The Fc receptor causes the transfer of maternal IgG molecules to the fetus to transfer immunity to the neonate.&nbsp; Another class I-like molecule of interest in the Bj&ouml;rkman lab is HFE, which is defective in human hereditary hemochromatosis, an iron metabolism disease causing iron overload.&nbsp; Bj&ouml;rkman studies the interactions of HFE with the transferrin receptor, and how it affects binding of transferrin and iron uptake by cells.&nbsp; Yet another example of a class I-like molecule is the Zn-&alpha;2-glycoprotein (ZAG), which has been implicated in cachexia, a wasting syndrome affecting terminally ill patients.&nbsp; Structures determined in the Bj&ouml;rkman lab showed how ZAG binds non-peptide ligands in its hydrophobic groove. </p>
          <p>A recurring theme in Bj&ouml;rkman&rsquo;s research is therefore the class I MHC fold, and her work has highlighted the diversity of functions performed by these class I-like molecules.&nbsp; However, as a true structural biologist, the static pictures provided by x-ray crystallography are often only the beginning of Bj&ouml;rkman&rsquo;s studies.&nbsp; The crystal structures are followed by biochemical and biophysical analyses of the proteins and their interactions with biological ligands.&nbsp; More recently, Bj&ouml;rkman&rsquo;s research is moving to a larger scale, using electron microscopy and confocal imaging of HFE and the Fc receptor at work inside cells.&nbsp; The combination of molecular and cell-based techniques will likely yield many more insights into the biological mechanisms of these proteins. </p>

          </table>Pamela Bj&ouml;rkman&rsquo;s work has been recognized by numerous awards.&nbsp; Notably, she is a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the National Academy of Sciences and the American Philosophical Society.&nbsp; Her Bloch lecture is titled &quot;Immunoglobulin Receptor Structure and Function from Molecules to Cells&quot;.&nbsp; The lecture, sponsored by Pfizer, honors Harvard faculty member and Nobel-prize recipient <a href="http://www.nobel.se/medicine/laureates/1964/bloch-bio.html">Konrad Bloch</a> (1912-2000), a pioneer in the field of cholesterol and lipid metabolism.&nbsp; </p>
