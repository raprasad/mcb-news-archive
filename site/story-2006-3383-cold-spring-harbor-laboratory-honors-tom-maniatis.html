		    <a href="/Faculty/faculty_profile.php?f=tom-maniatis">Tom Maniatis</a> has been awarded an honorary degree from <a href="http://www.cshl.edu">Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory</a>.&nbsp; The Thomas H. Lee Professor of Molecular and Cellular Biology was recognized for&nbsp; a lifetime of achievement as an outstanding scholar and researcher. </p>
		    <p>Among many his accomplishments, Cold Spring Harbor noted, &quot;Dr. Maniatis is best known for pioneering the development and application of recombinant DNA methods.&nbsp; These methods were disseminated worldwide through the publication of the book <em>Molecular Cloning</em>, co-authored by Dr. Maniatis &hellip;[and] published by the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press&hellip;&nbsp; [He] has played an important role in founding the biotechnology industry, serving as director and scientific advisor for companies that developed several FDA-approved drugs.&nbsp; These include treatments for hemophilia, anemia, bone disease and leukemia.&nbsp; These contributions were recognized with the Jacob Heskel Gabbay Award in Biotechnology and Medicine, shared with Drs. William Rutter and David Goeddel.&quot;</p>
		    <p>Dr. Maniatis expressed great pleasure in the honor.&nbsp; &quot;The Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory has been at the center of my scientific life, from the phage meetings I attended&nbsp; as a graduate student, to the development of cDNA cloning methods as a member of the scientific staff, to teaching the Molecular Cloning Course in the summers of 1980 and 1981.&nbsp; The <em>Molecular Cloning</em> Manual, which was based on this course, was written at the lab with Ed Fritch and Joe Sambrook.&nbsp; This degree is a very special honor because of my life-long connection with Cold Spring Harbor.&quot;</p>
		    <p>In addition to his outstanding research, Cold Spring Harbor cited Dr. Maniatis&rsquo;s broader work in the scientific community:&nbsp; &quot;Through his support of scientific education, Dr. Maniatis has promoted learning among scientists on every academic level.&nbsp; From textbooks to advanced courses, he has provided a mechanism for active scientists to remain abreast of new techniques and technology, qualities for which we honor him today.&quot;</p>
