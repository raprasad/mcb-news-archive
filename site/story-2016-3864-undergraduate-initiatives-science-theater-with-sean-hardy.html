            <div class="FloatL" style="width:280px;">

<p>
	&ldquo;Often people tell me I&rsquo;m doing two disparate things: science and theater,&rdquo; but <a href="http://lifesciences.fas.harvard.edu/neurobiology">neurobiology</a> concentrator Sean Hardy &rsquo;16 doesn&rsquo;t see it that way. After a good conversation&mdash;facilitated, perhaps, by student organization <a href="https://sciencetheater.wordpress.com/">Science-Theater at Harvard College</a>&mdash;&ldquo;I think scientists and artists would be surprised by the similar ways in which they approach problems.&rdquo; Both fields, Hardy reflects, rely on &ldquo;total dedication to your work, endless questioning&rdquo; and enduring &ldquo;loads of failure.&rdquo; Science, like art, &ldquo;is creative and innovative, while art [like science] requires applied method to practice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Hardy majored in drama at New York City&rsquo;s Laguardia High School and planned to pursue his passion for the science of emotion as a cognitive neuroscience concentrator at Harvard&mdash;until MCB 105: Systems Neuroscience with <a href="https://www.mcb.harvard.edu/mcb/faculty/profile/florian-engert/">Florian Engert</a>. The course &ldquo;introduced me to the variety of amazing ways brain circuitry maps stimuli to generate behavior&rdquo; and unleashed a &ldquo;love of neurons&rdquo; that now unites his interdisciplinary studies. Currently conducting his thesis in the Engert lab, Hardy investigates &ldquo;how a fish feels water,&rdquo; using fluorescent viral tracing to label neurons from the sensory hair cells throughout a zebrafish brain.</p>
<p>
	Both the methodical mindset of bench work and the big-picture mentality of neuroscience prove an invaluable asset for Hardy as an actor, as a director, and as president of Science-Theater at Harvard College (ST@HC). Hardy and classmates, Jumai Yusuf (Neurobiology &lsquo;16) and Alona Bach (History of Science &lsquo;16), founded ST@HC in order to &ldquo;build and foster lasting connections between the arts and science communities on campus&rdquo; and &ldquo;provide funding and support to artists and scientists interested in creating theater that deals with science, technology, and their wide implications on society.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Liaisons between the arts and sciences are vital to communicating scientific knowledge to the public, Hardy contends. ST@HC has &ldquo;allowed me to ask critical questions about why science matters and given me the tools to accurately articulate that to a general audience.&rdquo; In 2014, for instance, Hardy directed a staged reading of Lauren Gunderson&rsquo;s Silent Sky, which explores the life and work of astronomer Henrietta Swan Leavitt. After the reading, performed in the same Harvard observatory where Leavitt herself worked, ST@HC hosted a panel discussion on women in science, at which faculty and graduate and undergraduate students reflected on the play and their own experience in their fields. To Hardy&rsquo;s delight, Silent Sky was well attended by an audience including scientists, students, and drama buffs from universities across the greater Boston area.</p>
<p>
	As his last semester at Harvard hurdles by, Hardy faces a win-win decision between graduate programs&mdash;study theater in Paris or clinical neuroscience at Cambridge University? In the meantime, he looks forward to ST@HC&rsquo;s spring premiere of Shiver, an experimental work by neurobiology concentrator Jumai Yusuf &rsquo;16. Hopefully, Shiver and ensuing projects will kindle more collaborative relationships between Harvard undergraduates, grad students, and faculty so that ST@HC&rsquo;s foundational dialogue will continue long after its founders graduate.</p>
<p>
	Funded by grants from Harvard&rsquo;s Office for the Arts, the Harvard College Women&rsquo;s Center, and the Undergraduate Council, ST@HC&rsquo;s theater lab, like any research laboratory, provides a space &ldquo;to dare to fail and try new things.&rdquo; Disproving the false opposition between disciplines, Hardy found that the Harvard community shares his &ldquo;intrepid commitment to art-making&rdquo; and faith in the fertile interface between science and the arts.</p>
