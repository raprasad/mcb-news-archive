          <p class="Medium">Osnabr&uuml;ck Awards Honorary Degree</p>
          <p>On March 26, Professor <a href="/Faculty/faculty_profile.php?f=howard-berg-c">Howard Berg</a> of MCB was awarded a Doctor of Science <em>honoris causa</em> degree from the <a href="http://www.uni-osnabrueck.de/">University of Osnabr&uuml;ck</a>&rsquo;s Faculty of Biology and Chemistry.&nbsp; Prof. Dr. Karlheinz Altendorf, the Faculty&rsquo;s Dean, noted Dr. Berg&rsquo;s &quot;pathbreaking work&quot;, and the Faculty&rsquo;s March 26 announcement cited his &quot;key contributions towards understanding how the interplay between random and targeted forces governs the nano-mechanics of cells.&quot;&nbsp; The German University also notes the range of Dr. Berg&rsquo;s interests:&nbsp;He &quot;notably represents the holistic concept of the Life Sciences &ndash; from the physics of molecules to the lifestyle of organisms &ndash; to which the Biology Department of Osnabr&uuml;ck is committed.&quot;</p>
          <p class="Medium">Biophysical Society/U.S. Genomics Award in Single Molecule Biology</p>
          <p>On March 6, Dr. Berg <a href="/Faculty/faculty_profile.php?f=howard-berg-c"></a> was  presented with the <a href="http://www.biophysics.org/">Biophysical Society</a>&rsquo;s annual U.S. Genomics Award for Outstanding Investigator in the Field of Single Molecule Biology (SMB).&nbsp; The presentation was made at the 51st Annual Meeting of the Society, held in Baltimore.</p>
          <p>Sponsored by U.S. Genomics, the Award &quot;was established to recognize an exceptional researcher for seminal contributions in the field&quot; of SMB.&nbsp; Joe Falke, incoming President of the Biophysical Society, noted on the Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology News website that &quot;Dr. Berg not only helped to found this modern field by establishing the very first single-motor assay, but continues today to lead the way with his unique and innovative approaches to single-cell and single-molecule physiology.&quot; In addition to his research on flagellar rotary motors, Dr. Berg was recognized for developing devices, including trackers, sensors and optical traps, that laid the basis for much of today&rsquo;s instrumentation in SMB.</p>
          <p>Beyond recognizing pioneering accomplishments in SMB research, the Award is also &quot;intended to encourage and promote work in this area of biophysics and importantly, to promote cross-disciplinary collaboration&quot;.  In this respect Dr. Berg is an exemplar.  He is currently Herchel Smith Professor of Physics and Professor of Molecular and Cellular Biology in MCB, a member of the <a href="http://www.rowland.harvard.edu">Rowland Institute</a>, and has participated in numerous interdisciplinary efforts, such as Harvard's <a href="http://www.physicalbiology.fas.harvard.edu/">da Vinci Initiative</a>.</p>
