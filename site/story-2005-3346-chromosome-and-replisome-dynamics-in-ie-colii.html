              <br /><b>Figure 2: </b>Progression of nucleoid, origin and terminus FISH, and DnaX-GFP localization during the first 30 minutes of the cell cycle (cell birth through initiation of DNA replication). &nbsp;</div>
            All cells are faced with two very basic problems each cell cycle: (i) they must coordinate DNA replication with cell division such that replication occurs both in a timely manner and only once per cell cycle, and (ii) they must precisely segregate replicated (sister) chromosomes into two daughter cells.&nbsp; Recent work of David Bates and <a href="/Faculty/faculty_profile.php?f=nancy-kleckner">Nancy Kleckner</a> has addressed these problems in the model organism, <i>E. coli</i> (<a href="http://www.cell.com/content/article/abstract?uid=PIIS0092867405003934">Bates and Kleckner, 2005</a>).&nbsp; Using a novel &quot;baby cell machine&quot;, they have examined chromosome and replisome dynamics in synchronously growing cells by a mixture of cytological and molecular methods.&nbsp; One of the chief discoveries was that replicated sister chromosomes are aligned together (cohesion) for a significant amount of time after they are synthesized and then segregate to opposite sides of the cell in a single global transition.&nbsp; This mode of segregation has strong parallels in eukaryotic cells, and the authors propose that DNA segregation in <i>E. coli</i> may represent a primordial form of modern mitosis, upon which microtubule-based processes were later added.</p>
            <p>Another finding is that the chromosome experiences a very specific and predictable change in behavior during the final stages of cell division.&nbsp; After the end of DNA replication up to the time of cell division, sister chromosomes remain relatively static or &quot;frozen&quot; with a characteristic terminus-in / origin-out configuration.&nbsp; Thus, sister chromosomes are oriented tail-to-tail (the terminus being the last part to replicate, and origins being the first) for the later part of the cell cycle.&nbsp; The chromosome masses, or nucleoids, remain in close contact with the midcell division plane (septum) (Figure 1).&nbsp; Concurrent with cell division, however, the nucleoid moves dramatically to the middle of each daughter cell (Figure 2).&nbsp; Origin and terminus loci move in line with the nucleoid, and immediately their positions become highly dynamic, or &quot;unfrozen&quot;.&nbsp; The origin then moves to a fixed assembly of replication proteins (replisome) at midcell and DNA replication is initiated.&nbsp; The authors hypothesize that replication initiation in the next round is triggered or &quot;licensed&quot; by the completion of cell division via these changes in the nucleoid.&nbsp; Such a system ensures a 1:1 relationship between replication and division. </p>
