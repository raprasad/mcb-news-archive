		    <a href="/Faculty/faculty_profile.php?f=rachelle-gaudet">Rachelle Gaudet</a> has been selected to receive a Klingenstein Fellowship Award in the Neurosciences for 2007 for her project, &quot;Structural biology of temperature sensing by the TRPM8 channel&quot;. Gaudet, Associate Professor in MCB, will received $150,000 over a three-year period beginning July 1. TRPM8 is an ion channel that is gated open by cool temperatures and cool-tasting compounds like menthol. The project goal is to determine the TRPM8 structure and activation mechanisms through x-ray crystallography and complementary mutagenesis and electrophysiology experiments.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
		    <p>Many neurological diseases are channelopathies, i.e., diseases resulting from the malfunction of ion channels, including several forms of epilepsy.&nbsp; This made the project especially suitable for this Fellowship. The Klingenstein Fellowship Awards, from the <a href="http://www.klingfund.org/fellows/fellows07.php">Esther A. and Joseph Klingenstein Fund, Inc.</a>, were created &quot;to support, in the early stages of their careers, young investigators in basic or clinical research that may lead to a better understanding of epilepsy.&quot; No more than ten Fellowships are awarded each year.</p>
		  <p>Specifically, the program focuses on areas within the neurosciences with a recognition of the &quot;necessity to encourage a variety of new approaches&quot;. In Gaudet&rsquo;s project, the three-dimensional structure of ion channels in different functional states will provide new insights into the relationships between their structures, functions and mechanisms of action.&nbsp; Gaudet remarks:&nbsp; &quot;This understanding of the molecular mechanisms of ion channel regulation and gating is crucial to the development of therapies for many neurological diseases.&quot; </p>
		  <p>Gaudet expressed her gratitude and appreciation for the Award:&nbsp; &quot;The neuroscience community has been very supportive of our efforts to determine structures of TRP channels, and it is an honor to receive financial support through a Klingenstein Fellowship.&nbsp; I'm really excited about this project on TRPM8 because we have already made great progress, and this new funding with few restrictions will allow us to really push it forward.&quot;</p>
