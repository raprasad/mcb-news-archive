<p>
	Neurons in the brain extend elaborately branched dendrites that receive inputs from other neurons and sensory stimuli.&nbsp; In some cases, the dendrites exhibit a behavior called self-avoidance, in which individual branches keep to themselves, seemingly repelling each other.&nbsp; Self-avoidance serves to minimize gaps and overlaps in a neuron&rsquo;s arbor, thereby allowing it to maximize the number of inputs it receives.&nbsp; However, self-avoidance comes with a price:&nbsp; dendrites of some neurons need to form synaptic connections with dendrites of other neurons of the same type.&nbsp; These dendrites need to solve the difficult problem of &ldquo;self/non-self discrimination,&rdquo; avoiding other dendrites from the same cell while connecting with dendrites of other, seemingly identical cells. In a paper in Nature, Lefebvre et al. show that part of the secret lies in a complex set of 22 genes called gamma-protocadherins.&nbsp; Using several lines of genetically engineered mice, they show that self-avoidance fails in particular cell types of the retina and cerebellum when the gamma-protocadherins are absent.&nbsp; Dendrites grow normally, but fail to repel each other and thus clump up. But if all cells have gamma-protocadherins, why do dendrites of neighboring cells not avoid each other?&nbsp; Lefebvre et al. hypothesized that each cell bears only a few of the gamma-protocadherins, chosen at random from the full set of 22, and that dendrites only repel when they bear the same subset.&nbsp;&nbsp; Normally, the only time a dendrite would encounter a perfect match is in another dendrite of the same cell.&nbsp; Lefebvre et al. realized they could test this idea by expressing the same gamma-protocadherin in all neurons of a particular type and asking whether dendrites were now unable to distinguish self from non-self, and ended up avoiding neighboring cells.&nbsp; In fact, that is exactly what they saw, supporting the idea that protocadherins can help give each neuron within a group a unique molecular identity.</p>
<p>
	Matters are still more complicated, though &ndash;the gamma-protocadherins are required for survival of some cells as well as self-avoidance in others.&nbsp; Lefebvre et al. collaborated with Weisheng Chen and Tom Maniatis, formerly in MCB and now at Columbia, to disentangle these two functions.&nbsp; In another surprising twist, it turns out that any gamma-protocadherin can function in self-avoidance but only a few promote survival.&nbsp; Some of the results of this collaborative study are presented in the paper by Lefebvre et al., and others in a paper by Chen et al., appearing simultaneously in Neuron.&nbsp; How these remarkable genes manage to perform these two very different tasks is the subject of ongoing work between the two groups.</p>
