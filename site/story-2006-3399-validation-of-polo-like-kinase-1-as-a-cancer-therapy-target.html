            A new study from the Erikson lab by Xiaoqi Liu and Ming Lei (just appearing in <a href="http://mcb.asm.org/cgi/content/full/26/6/2093">Molecular and Cellular Biology</a>) offers important insight into the function of Polo-like kinase 1 and its role in cell regulation and carcinogenesis in mammalian cells.            </p>
            <p>Genetic and biochemical experiments with several different organisms have documented that the polo-like kinase (Plk) family serves as a vital regulator in many aspects of cell cycle progression.&nbsp; The mammalian family includes Plk1, an enzyme active in mitosis, and two other enzymes, Plk2 and Plk3, active early in the cell cycle. </p>
            <p>A close correlation between mammalian Plk1 expression and carcinogenesis has been documented, and over-expression of Plk1 is observed in various human tumors.&nbsp; For example, elevated Plk1 expression is detected in human melanomas, and, furthermore, patients with moderate Plk1 expression survive significantly longer than those with high Plk1 levels.&nbsp; Similarly, non-small cell lung cancer patients whose tumors show moderate Plk1 expression survive significantly longer than those patients with high levels of Plk1 transcripts.&nbsp; Analysis of patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinomas, oropharyngeal carcinomas, ovarian and endometrial carcinomas, and esophageal and gastric cancer has revealed a close correlation between lower survival rates and higher Plk1 expression levels.&nbsp; Thus, it was proposed that Plk1 could serve as a novel diagnostic marker for several types of cancers, and that inhibition of Plk1 function may be an important approach for cancer therapy.</p>
            <p>To document its functions in mammalian cells in more detail, the authors reported previously on the phenotype of cultured cancer cells after Plk1 depletion by the use of interfering RNA (RNAi).&nbsp; This approach revealed an essential role of Plk1 for cell proliferation and viability.&nbsp; Moreover, Plk1 depletion in cancer cells over an extended time induced apoptosis (cell death), as supported by the appearance of sub-genomic DNA, the activation of caspase 3, and the formation of fragmented nuclei.&nbsp; </p>
            <p>Because inhibition of cell proliferation and activation of apoptosis are fundamental approaches to cancer therapy, it was of interest to test the effect of Plk1 depletion in normal human cells.&nbsp; In this study performed by Liu, a post-doctoral fellow in the lab, and Lei, a graduate student, Plk1 was depleted in several lines of normal human cells.&nbsp; In striking contrast to cancer cells, normal human cells were much less sensitive to Plk1 depletion; no apparent proliferation defect or cell cycle arrest was observed after Plk1 depletion.&nbsp; To probe for a possible mechanism for this result, p53 which is frequently mutated or absent in cancer cells, was depleted with RNAi in MCF10A, a normal human cell line, to render it more like a cancer cell.&nbsp; Depletion of p53 did not cause any immediate phenotypic changes and cells proliferated normally for several weeks. </p>
            <p>However, upon subsequent severe depletion of Plk1, p53-depleted MCF10A cells were arrested prior to mitosis, but subsequently exhibited sub-genomic DNA, consistent with apoptosis events.&nbsp; Thus, under these conditions, otherwise normal p53-depleted MCF10A cells mimic cancer cells.&nbsp; Taken together, these data suggest new approaches for the study of Plk1 function in cell regulation and survival, and also emphasize the potential of Plk1 as a target in cancer therapy.</p>
