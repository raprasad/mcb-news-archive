	Eight undergraduate concentrators from Chemical and Physical Biology (CPB)&nbsp; and Neurobiology received Hoopes Prizes for their theses in May 2015.</p>
<p>
	The&nbsp;<a href="http://isites.harvard.edu/icb/icb.do?keyword=k78478&amp;tabgroupid=icb.tabgroup122123">Thomas Temple Hoopes Prize</a>, a Harvard College-wide honor, was established in 1982 to &ldquo;grant awards to undergraduates on the basis of outstanding scholarly work or research.&rdquo; The Hoopes Prize particularly recognizes scholarly writing and presentation.&nbsp; Each of this year&rsquo;s winners receives a cash award of $4,000.&nbsp; Their nominators receive $1,500.</p>
<p>
	The CPB&nbsp; and Neurobiology concentrators who won a 2015 Hoopes Prize are:</p>
<p>

<p>
	<strong>Alexandra Rojek </strong>(CPB) for her submission entitled &quot;A Regulatory Model of Heat Shock by Protein Assembly&quot; - nominated by Professor D. Allan Drummond</p>
<p>
	<strong>Marissa Shoji</strong> (Neurobiology) for her submission entitled &quot; Characterization of the Activity of Glutamatergic Neurons in the&nbsp;Pedunculopontine Tegmentum During Decision-Making&quot; - nominated by Professor <a href="https://www.mcb.harvard.edu/mcb/faculty/profile/nao-uchida/">Nao Uchida</a></p>

<p>
	<em><em>The&nbsp;John E. Dowling&nbsp;Thesis Prize was established in 2012 to commemorate the retirement of Harvard scientist, teacher, and Neurobiology Head Tutor&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mcb.harvard.edu/mcb/faculty/profile/john-e-dowling/">John E. Dowling</a>. This award marks outstanding scientific achievement in the field of Neurobiology. The awardee receives a framed certificate and a $500 prize.</em></em></p>
<p>
	The 2015 John E. Dowling Thesis Prize was awarded to Bianca Nfonoyim for her thesis &quot;Microglia Mediate Synapse Loss in Early Stage Alzheimer&rsquo;s Disease Via the Classical Complement Cascade&rdquo;.&nbsp; In this thesis, Bianca investigated the role of a subtype of glia cells known to be involved in innate immune defense and inflammation response in the brain. Using a variety of cellular and molecular approaches, Bianca studied how and when mircoglia are involved in synapse loss in mouse models of Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease. Ultimately, she found microglia were actively engulfing synapses at very early (pre-plaque) disease stages. Bianca performed her thesis research in Beth Steven&rsquo;s lab at Harvard Medical School.</p>

	<strong>Alexandra Rojek wins the 2015 Lawrence J. Henderson Prize</strong></p>
<div class="FloatL" style="width:200px;">

<p>
	<em><em>The Lawrence J. Henderson Prize is awarded to the student who submits the most meritorious thesis to the Board of Tutors in Biochemical Sciences.&nbsp; The recipients receive a $500 book award, a framed certificate, and a copy of &quot;Fitness of the Environment&quot; by Professor Lawrence J. Henderson (1878-1942).</em></em></p>
<p>
	The 2015 Lawrence J. Henderson Prize was awarded to Alexandra Rojek for her thesis &ldquo;A Regulatory Model of Heat Shock by Protein Assembly&rdquo;, which was carried out in D. Allan Drummond&rsquo;s laboratory at the University of Chicago. In her thesis, Alexandra describes exciting data that support a new model for the response of cellular proteins to heat shock; she shows that many proteins involved in the translation pathway and critical to the heat shock response do not simply coalesce into non-functional aggregates but self-assemble into massive functional complexes that may play an important function in regulating the translational response of the cell to heat shock stress.<br />

	<strong>Three additional students&mdash;two Organismic and Evolutionary Biology (OEB) concentrators and one Computer Science (CS) concentrator&mdash;who are also in MCB labs received Hoopes Prizes.<br />
	&nbsp;</strong><br />
	<strong>Ruth Fong </strong>(CS) for her submission entitled &ldquo;Leveraging Human Brain Activity to Improve Object Classification&rdquo; &ndash; nominated by Professor <a href="https://www.mcb.harvard.edu/mcb/faculty/profile/david-cox/">David Cox</a><br />
	<br />
	<strong>Young Kwon</strong> (OEB) for her submission entitled &ldquo;The Genetic Basis of Parental Care in Peromyscus&rdquo; &ndash; nominated by Professor <a href="https://www.mcb.harvard.edu/mcb/faculty/profile/hopi-hoekstra/">Hopi Hoekstra</a><br />
	<br />
	<strong>Tess Linden </strong>(OEB) for her submission entitled &ldquo;The role of Agouti isoforms in the evolution of convergent pigmentation phenotypes in Peromyscus mice&rdquo; &ndash; nominated by Professor <a href="https://www.mcb.harvard.edu/mcb/faculty/profile/hopi-hoekstra/">Hopi Hoekstra</a></p>
