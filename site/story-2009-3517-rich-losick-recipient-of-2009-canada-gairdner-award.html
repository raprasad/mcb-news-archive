	<a href="http://www.gairdner.org/">The Gairdner Foundation</a> announced on March 31 that MCB's <a href="http://www.mcb.harvard.edu/Faculty/faculty_profile.php?f=richard-losick-m">Maria Moors Cabot Professor of Biology Rich Losick</a> was one of seven recipients of its 2009 Canada Gairdner Awards.</p>
		  <p>Given annually to leading scientists, the Gairdner is one of the most prestigious awards in biomedical research.  The awards are sometimes known as the &ldquo;Baby Nobels&rdquo; - of 298 recipients, 73, or one in four, have gone on to win the Nobel Prize.</p>
		  <p>Losick was in Toronto for the press conference announcement of this year's awards.  &ldquo;I found out about a month and a half ago, when they swore me to secrecy,&rdquo; Losick said.  &ldquo;The whole thing was an enormous surprise, and much more than I ever thought I'd do.&rdquo;</p>
		  <p>Losick and his fellow honoree, Dr. David Sackett of McMaster University, gave short talks on their work at the announcement luncheon, and then again for a reception at the home of the President of the University of Toronto.</p>
		  <p>The awards themselves will be presented in late October, at a multi-day, gala event honoring this year's winners, as well as the Foundation's 50th anniversary.  The festivities include a black-tie dinner, and multiple lectures and symposia.  Fifty former Gairdner recipients will be on hand, 22 of them Nobel Laureates.		    </p>
		  <p>The other honorees are Sackett, for his work on improving medical care; stem-cell researcher Shinya Yamanaka, of Kyoto University; Nubia Munoz, emeritus professor of the National Cancer Institute in Colombia, for her work on a vaccine for cervical cancer; Kyoto University's Kazutoshi Mori and Peter Walter, of the University of California at San Francisco, for the investigation of how proteins are folded into cells; and Stanford's Lucy Shapiro who was honored, along with Losick, for basic research on bacteria growth, division and dormancy.</p>
		  <p> Losick was particularly pleased that Shapiro, a long time collaborator of his, also received the prize this year.</p>
		  <p> &ldquo;We've been friends for over 30 years,&rdquo; Losick said of Shapiro. &ldquo;We share notes and ideas all the time.  [Her award] &ldquo;is icing on the cake.&rdquo;</p>
