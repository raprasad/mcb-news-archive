	<a href="https://www.mcb.harvard.edu/mcb/faculty/profile/ethan-garner/">Ethan Garner</a>, Assistant Professor of Molecular and Cellular Biology, has been named a Searle Scholar. He is one of 15 exceptional young faculty nationwide to receive this prestigious honor from the Searle Scholars Program.<br />
	<br />
	The <a href="http://www.searlescholars.net/go.php?id=1">Searle Scholars Program</a>, based in Chicago, supports the independent research of outstanding and innovative young scientists in chemistry, medicine, and the biological sciences who have recently begun their first tenure-track position at one of the 115 participating academic or research institutions. Application submissions are restricted to selected candidates from invited institutions only. Recipients will receive $100,000 per year for three years.<br />
	<br />
	&quot;I&#39;m really&nbsp;grateful&nbsp;for this award,&rdquo; Garner says. &ldquo;Having the support of the Searle is going to help me launch my research at this early stage of my career.&rdquo; Among his plans for the Searle project, he will be hiring a postdoctoral scientist and buying microscopy equipment for his research.<br />
	<br />
	Garner&rsquo;s work focuses on elucidating the mechanisms of cell wall synthesis in rod-shaped bacteria and its regulation by actin and tubulin filaments. The goal is to discover new points in the pathways to develop antibiotic targets, a pressing need as resistance to natural antibiotics is becoming increasingly prevalent. He uses supermicroscopy, sub-diffraction imaging, particle tracking, biochemistry and genetics to follow the motion and changing structure of single molecules in living cells.<br />
	<br />
	Garner joins a community of renowned Searle alumni, including MCB Chair Catherine Dulac (1998). Since its inception, 497 Scholars have been named and over $102 million has been awarded. The Searle Scholars Program was established at The Chicago Community Trust in 1980 and has been administered by Kinship Foundation since 1996.<br />
