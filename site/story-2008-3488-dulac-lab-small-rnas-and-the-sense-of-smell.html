	Modern genetics textbooks highlight the concept of the &lsquo;central dogma&rsquo; which states that DNA is transcribed into messenger RNA (mRNA) and that mRNA is subsequently translated into proteins.&nbsp; Yet, only a small fraction (~2-3%) of these mRNAs actually encodes proteins in higher eukaryotes.&nbsp; What do the rest of the mRNAs do?&nbsp; It is becoming increasingly appreciated that many of these mRNAs comprise non-coding RNA that play critical roles as gene regulators.&nbsp; One specific class of non-coding RNAs is called microRNAs (miRNAs), which, as the name suggests, are short ~22-26 nucleotide RNAs that regulate gene expression by directing degradation and/or preventing translation of protein encoding mRNAs.&nbsp; It is widely believed that higher vertebrates like human and mice harbor 400-500 genomic miRNAs which act either alone or in combination to regulate ~30% of their genes and to control such varied processes as heart formation, stem cell division, and lung development.&nbsp; Which miRNAs act on which target genes to affect which developmental processes?</p>
<p>
	Our lab has been interested in understanding the mechanisms that regulate development of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs), which are the cells that detect odorants in the environment.&nbsp; While most research in the field has focused on protein regulators of genes called transcription factors, we wondered whether non-coding RNAs might play an important role.&nbsp; Now, in a study published in Neuron (<a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com.ezp1.harvard.edu/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6WSS-4RJBWNR-8&amp;_user=209690&amp;_coverDate=01%2F10%2F2008&amp;_rdoc=8&amp;_fmt=summary&amp;_orig=browse&amp;_srch=doc-info(%23toc%237054%232008%23999429998%23678164%23FLA%23display%23Volume)&amp;_cdi=7054&amp;_sort=d&amp;_docanchor=&amp;_ct=17&amp;_acct=C000014438&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=209690&amp;md5=cd2b8ecc844d3b46ffd06efa49124ca2">Choi et al., 2008</a>), we show that at least 90 miRNAs are expressed in the olfactory system of mice and that the miR-200 family of miRNAs is particularly important for development of progenitor cells into OSNs.</p>
<p>
	Initially, we were intrigued that no abnormal phenotypes arose when we eliminated the function of those miRNAs expressed in mature OSNs.&nbsp; However, eliminating the function of those miRNAs expressed in OSN progenitor cells prevented OSN maturation, resulting in cell death and indicating that miRNAs are specifically required for olfactory neurogenesis.&nbsp; We then took advantage of zebrafish, which allowed us to eliminate the function of individual miRNAs within an olfactory system that is remarkably conserved relative to mice.&nbsp; Inhibition of a single family (miR-200) of miRNAs, which we show to be specifically expressed in OSN progenitor cells, prevented development into mature OSNs, indicating that a single miRNA family is critically important for olfactory neurogenesis.</p>
<p>
	We are currently working to elucidate the targets through which the miR-200 family acts in this process and to further the zebrafish model as a platform for dissecting the functions of other interesting olfactory-expressed miRNAs.&nbsp; In the meantime, we hope that genetics textbooks will be updated to reflect the outsized role that small, non-coding RNAs play in developmental biology.</p>
