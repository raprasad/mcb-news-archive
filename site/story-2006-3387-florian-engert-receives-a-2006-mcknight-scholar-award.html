		  <a href="/Faculty/faculty_profile.php?f=florian-engert">Florian Engert</a>, Assistant Professor in the Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, is a recipient of the 2006 McKnight Scholar Award.<strong>&nbsp;</strong><a href="http://www.mcknight.org/neuroscience/">The McKnight Endowment Fund for Neuroscience</a>  seeks innovative research in the field of brain function and diseases; its prestigious three-year award is targeted specifically to young neurobiologists whose laboratories are in their early stages.&nbsp; Only a handful are selected each year. Engert comments:&nbsp; &quot;It is really a great privilege to be selected as a McKnight Scholar&quot;, and adds that &quot;what&rsquo;s particularly nice about the McKnight fellowship is that it sponsors high risk/high rewards projects and doesn&rsquo;t necessarily require a lot of preliminary data. This makes it possible to explore exciting projects that would otherwise be hard to fund.&quot;</p>
		  <p>A part of the McKnight Foundation, the McKnight Endowment Fund was established according to the wishes of 3M Corporation founder, William L. McKnight, who, according to the Foundation website, &quot;had a personal interest in memory and its diseases. He chose to set aside part of his legacy to bring hope to those suffering from brain injury or disease and cognitive impairment.&quot;</p>
		  <p>Nonetheless, the Scholar Award endows basic science, not direct medical research. Engert is excited by the perspectives opened by the Award: a &quot;big advantage is that the funds are pretty much unrestricted, which considerably increases your flexibility in where you want to take the project.&quot; As Engert&rsquo;s research has focused on synaptic plasticity, especially in its relevance to learning and memory, the latitude afforded by the McKnight Endowment Fund&rsquo;s award should offer Engert a great opportunity to enjoy the very facility he will be studying.</p>
